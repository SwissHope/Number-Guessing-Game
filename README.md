#######  Number Guessing Game #######

This is an example console based application that generates three random numbers and challenges the user to guess what the numbers are.

It provides hints in the form of telling the player the sum and product of the three numbers. At this stage, the game starts at level 1 and increments up to level 16.

README.md will be filled with more information soon, as the code itself needs commenting (for future reference sake) and it requires the implementation of a system that
is perhaps more engaging than the current system that is in place.

The code will loop, as required, to achieve the outcome.

At this stage, it's unclear what can be added, but that will become clear, in due time.

Suggestions are welcome, if you feel that some could be made.
